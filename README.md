# Pixel-Art-Marker
An Udacity/Google Africa Challenge Scholarship - Front End project

This project takes user values and creates an art canvas dynamically using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

The frontend was designed using HTML, CSS and the Bootstrap CSS framework.

The behaviour (creating the canvas, making a pixel art, resetting the canvas) was achieved using jQuery and some vanilla Javascript.
